# Jupyter Distinguished Contributors Elections process

## 1] Call for elections shepherds

The shepherd(s) of 20XX-1 JDC election should send an email to the [JDC mailing list](jupyter-distinguished-contributors@googlegroups.com) in early December 20XX, asking for volunteers to shepherd the 20XX election. Any JDC can participate in administering the JDC election, and how the work is split is let to the discretion of the organizers.

## 2] Nominations

The nominations for 20XX JDC should start in early January 20XX+1. The shepherd(s) should send an email to the [JDC mailing list](jupyter-distinguished-contributors@googlegroups.com) with the following elements:

- Number of available awards (currently 10 per year)
- A link to the form used for nominating someone. A Google Form template has been shared with the JDC Google groups, you can duplicate it (please do not use it directly so it can be reused for the next elections); you can also create a new form from [this document](https://github.com/jupyter/distinguished-contributors/blob/main/nomination-forms/2020.md)
- A reminder of the criteria for [Distinguished Contributor awards](https://jupyter.org/governance/distinguished_contributors.html#criteria-for-nominating-new-distinguished-contributors). The 2-year activity requirement should be as of December 31, 20XX.
- A deadline for the nomination phase; this phase should not exceed 2 or 3 weeks.

The elections shepherd(s) should not hesitate to send some reminders during the nomination phase.

Per Jupyter governance, each newly inducted member will be awarded a nominal purse of $500 per awardee, subject to budgetary constraints, in recognition for service to the community. The shepherd(s) is to send an email to the [Executive Council](jupyter-executive-council@googlegroups.com) requesting availability of budget for this round of prizes.

## 3] Vote

Once the nomination phase is over, the vote can start. There are two cases:

- if the number of nominees does not exceed the number of available awards, a simple form with "Yes / No / Abstain" options for each nominee can be used. `Abstain` is ignored, so the only requirement for a nominee to become a JDC is to get more `Yes` than `No` votes.
- if the number of nominees exceeds the number of available awards, a Condorcet ranked vote should be used. There are many Condorcet voting tools available online and this guide does not promote one over another.

The shepherd(s) should send an email to the [JDC mailing list](jupyter-distinguished-contributors@googlegroups.com) with the following elements:
- a link to the form or to the online Condorcet voting tool
- a summary of the nominations
- a deadline for the voting phase, should not exceed 1 month.

Again, the elections shepherd(s) should not hesitate to send some reminders during the voting phase.

## 4] Winners confirmation

When the vote is over, the shepherds should communicate the list of winners the [JDC mailing list](jupyter-distinguished-contributors@googlegroups.com). An email should also be sent to the [Jupyter Community Building Committee](jupyter-community-building-committee@googlegroups.com) and to people in charge of Resources at [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/community/people), to keep them informed about the progress of the JDC grant process.
Traditionally, the person who has nominated a winner sends him an email asking for confirmation, but this can be done by any Distinguished Contributors. A typical email would be (for the most lazy or busy of us ;)):

```
Dear XXX,

On behalf of the Jupyter Distinguished Contributors, I am happy to share that you have been selected to receive the award of Jupyter Distinguished Contributor! Congratulations and many thanks for the significant impact you have made in our community. The time, energy, and effort you have so generously given is highly appreciated, welcomed, and celebrated.
 
As you may recall, Project Jupyter established a "Distinguished Contributor" award [1] to recognize the work of contributors that is sustained over at least two years and is substantial in quality / quantity.

Informations about the winners (names, photos, whether they accept the award) can be tracked on the Google Spreadsheet shared with the JDC Google group.

## 5] Public announcement

When all the winners have confirmed (or declined) the award, the 20XX JDC cohort can be publicly announced:
- ideally during a Jupyter Event such as the JupyterCon if the calendar matches
- in a blogpost on the [Jupyter Blog](https://blog.jupyter.org), written by the elections shepherd(s)
- on the [Jupyter Website](https://jupyter.org/about#distinguished-contributors)

The new Distinguished Contributors can then be added to the JDC Google group.
